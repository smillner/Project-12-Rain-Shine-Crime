# Rain-Shine-Crime (Work in Progress)

This app will retrieve weather data and crime stats by your current location or the city you search for.

This app displays my use of the MEAN stack and particularly Angular 2 using Typescript and ES6.

The app is live @ https://rain-shine-crime.herokuapp.com/

## Prerequisites ##

Node.js to run server locally

MondoDB to create the database

## Installing ##

Run `npm install` in a separate terminal to download all dependencies.

Run `mongod` to start MondoDB.

Run `npm start` to start express server.

Run `ng serve` or `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Deployment ##

Run `npm run build` to build to dist folder

Run `npm start` to serve app and start express server

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
